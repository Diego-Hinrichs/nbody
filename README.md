- [ ] Add a new option to choose the mass distribution: uniform or normal
- [ ] Optimize the frequency at which the points are re-ordered
- [ ] Implement the SPH method with fixed radius (parameter `r`)
- [ ] Allow the program to be run via the terminal with essential options:
  - `/prog -n <particles> -radius <radius> -sort <0: none, 1: hilbert, 2: morton> -steps <steps> -mdist <0: uniform, 1:
